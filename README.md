# PyBer_Analysis.
analyze all the Rideshare Data for PyBer positioning 

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

As a Data analyst of a new rideshare company, the project analyzes five months of rideshare data of Company Pyber, which is valued at $ 2.3 Billion. The project requirement is to provide CEO V-Issualize with a compelling visualization presentation with Data Dashboards for :

1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

The project becomes more challenging as we all know that CEO has been herself a seasoned Data Analyst. 
Omar is my Manager and has been a great support.




# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## The total number of rides for each city type is retrieved. 


### Pie chart of the same gives us a better overivew of how the rides are ditributed with the three types.

As Expected the number of rides in the urban cities were the highest at 1625, followed by Sububran at 635 and lowest in rural at 125.

### Pie chart showing the fares distribution amount the three city type:

The total fares for urban is higher than both Suburabn and RUral put together. The total inched closer to $40,000 while it was approx $19,000 and $4000 in suburban and rural city type.The main revenue generated was from the Urban city type.


### Pie chart showing Drivers by city type

The number of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities was found much higher. The count evaluated was  2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. Again, the figure above is self explantory and shows  the significance of drivers in urban cities during the five month period of Jan to May 2019.

### Pyber summary based on fares for three city type 


As far as costs are concerned, we see that riders in rural cities pay an average of 10$ more for pyber rides than the urban city type. The mean fare per ride in Rural setup is $35 per ride, while the average fare per ride in Urban setup is 25$. Suburban see a mean fare of 31 $ per ride.

The drivers enjoy a better rate in the rural setup with an average of 55$ per ride but the drawback being fewer rides.


### Total Fare by city type

1. The resample data frame measured through the Total fare by city type is as pictured above.
2. The yellow graph provides us an oveirew of the fare flctuations between $1600 to $2300 during Jan 2019 to May 2019, for urban city setup . 
3. The Red graph gives us information that fares fluctates between 700$ & 1300$, while the Rural setup blue graph hovers around 300$ mark.


### The resampled DataFrame in Step 15, confirm that your DataFrame looks like this:

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. It is noted that more drivers are available in Urban setup compared ot Suburban adn Rural setup.
2. The end result of such driver concentration results in higher revenue genration in Urban comared to other areas.
3. The other result is number of rideshares are consderably higher in Urban setup compared to suburban and rural setup.
4. The rider cost for using pyber seems to be much higher in rural setup there by chances of consderable discouragment of usage of Pyber app for rural setup.
5. The potetnial increase of drivers being encouraged to move from Urban to suburban rides by additional revenue generation for providing eatery services can generate more revenue and traffic (rides).
6. The incentive model should be reviewd by Pyber to provide alternate services can help pyber to increase revenue in three city types.
7. Future option to grow pyber business in three cities, more so in Suburban and Rural city type will be to look into possible tie up with large retail giants like Amazon, Walmart. cotsco and others  to use pyber service for delivering products, returns, and bring additional income for rural drivers and clients.
