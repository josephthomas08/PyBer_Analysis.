As Expected the number of rides in the urban cities were the highest at 1625, followed by Sububran at 635 and lowest in rural at 125.

### Pie chart of the same gives us a better overivew of how the rides are ditributed with the three types.

There number of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities was found much higher. The count evaluated was  2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. Again, the figure above is self explantory and shows  the significance of drivers in urban cities during the five month period of Jan to May 2019.
